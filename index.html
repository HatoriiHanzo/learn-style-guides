    Code should always be lowercase.
    </p>
  <h2>
  What is the recommended encoding ?        
  </h2>
    <p>
    always use UTF-8 style sheets always assume this encoding, dont use it with BOM (byte order mark)
    </p>
  <h2>
  How should you use comment to explain code ? how do you do this in HTML and CSS ?
  </h2>
    <p>
    you use comments to remind yourself or others of what you have done ie changes made, or the purpose of a certain line of code,why is respective solution used or preferred?<br>
    for HTML you will use &lt;!-- --&gt;  ,<br>

    for CSS you will use /* */
    </p>
<h2>
    how do you validate your HTML ? 
</h2>
<p>
    you can use <a target="blank" href="https://validator.w3.org/nu/">w3 validator</a> to check your code
</p>
<h2>
    What is the purpose of the alt atribute ?
</h2>
<p>
    with the &lt;alt&gt; attribute you can define a name for a image for example which helps for blind people so the pc can read out what is there, also it helps when a image for example does not load it will always show what should be there.
</p>
<h2>
    Should you seperate structure (markup),presentation(styling),and behaviour(scripting), if yes, why ?
</h2>
<p>
    yes you should always seperate them this will help readability of any file drasticly but will also help you mae changes much faster and easier, also for other people that need to work on your old stuff it will be drasticly easier to understand anything you did then if you would have crammed it al in 1 file, it also helps with loading times of website's
</p>
<h2>
    Should you use double or single quotation marks around attribute values ?
</h2>
<p>
    the general rule is to use double, single can be used but is never recommended  
</p>
<h2>
    how can you validate you CSS code ?
</h2>
<p>
        you can use <a target="blank" href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">w3 validator</a> to check your code   
</p>
<h2>
    when would you use meaningfull ID/class names? When would you use generic ones ?
</h2>
<p>
        Use meaningful or generic ID and class names.<br>

        Instead of presentational or cryptic names, always use ID and class names that reflect the purpose of the element in question, or that are otherwise generic.<br>
        
        Names that are specific and reflect the purpose of the element should be preferred as these are most understandable and the least likely to change.<br>
        
        Generic names are simply a fallback for elements that have no particular or no meaning different from their siblings. They are typically needed as “helpers.”<br>
        
        Using functional or generic names reduces the probability of unnecessary document or template changes.<br>
